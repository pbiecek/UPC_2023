## Shift in our focus: Statistics

- Statistical analysis of data most often assumes a great deal of knowledge about the phenomenon. Understanding the data allows to choose appropriate transformations, representations. Verification is oriented toward hypothesis testing, such as by p-values

## Shift in our focus: Machine Learning

- Machine learning puts a priority on optimizing the model, especially for performance. There is a lot of searching through the space of possible solutions here to find the best one
- Knowledge of the phenomenon is no longer so important

## Shift in our focus: Human Oriented ML?

- What's next. If model building can be easily and quickly automated, in-depth model verification will become more important
- This is where models are created seamlessly according to the needs of the user, and the user can focus on decisions supported by the models
